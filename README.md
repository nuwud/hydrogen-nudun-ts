## 📌 Roadmap / WIP

- [ ] Link menu items to real Shopify products & collections
- [ ] Integrate `@react-spring/three` for animation
- [ ] Expose menu structure via metafields or CMS
- [ ] Animate camera or auto-focus on hover

## 💬 Why This Matters

This starter goes **beyond static layout** by giving Hydrogen the ability to:
- Present immersive menus with live product routes
- Use 3D interaction to represent categories, promos, brands
- Transition into full-page 3D experiences for luxury, games, or interactive narratives

If something works once, document it. If it fails twice, automate the fix. If it delights, ship it.

Would you like me to:
- Inject this as a file in your project?
- Make a lighter version to keep in the `docs/` folder?
- Create an `ABOUT.md` or `WATERMELON.md` for the component itself?

Also ready to help scaffold your changelog, issue template, or shopify.metafield schema next. Let’s keep it flowing, one clean commit at a time 🍉💻
